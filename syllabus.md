## Course description:
Language expression is a physical process that is inextricably tied to high-level mental processes. As such, it has the potential to shed light on the inner workings of an individual's thoughts and psyche. This course covers topics in psychology that are uniquely associated with written and oral language expression and how they can be modeled using natural language processing techniques. The goal of the course is to introduce students to research topics at the intersection of the two disciplines, focusing on how natural language processing techniques can help test psychological theories, and how psychological theories can help inform approaches to NLP applications. 
Topics covered will include: gender, deception, emotion, entrainment, trauma, mental illnesses, psychopathy, autism, liking and conflict, personality, dominance and influence.
